# TFTP-Using-UDP
Trivial File Transfer Protocol Using User Datagram Protocol 

## Introduction
This project was a course project for my Computer Networking course. The goal of this project was to create a GUI based file transfer system using two given classes, the UDPSender and UDPReceiver. 

## Instructions
* To send a message:
  * Type the desired message into the "Message" box.
  * Enter the receiving IP address into the "Send to" box.
  * Click "Send".
* Received messages automatically appear in the "Incoming Message" box, with the sending IP address appearing in the "Sent from" box.
